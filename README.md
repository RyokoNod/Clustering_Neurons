# Clustering neurons with graph-based methods

A summer project that clusters cells from the motor cortex of mice.<br>
This is based on a Nature article by Scala, F., Kobak, D., Bernabucci, M. *et al.* The original article can be found [here](https://rdcu.be/cmgFA).

## The dataset

The dataset in this repo is from the [original work](https://github.com/berenslab/mini-atlas). Additional instructions on downloading data can be found in the Jupyter notebooks.

## How to run the analysis

1. Run ```allen-data-preprocess-mod.ipynb``` to preprocess the Allen Institute data. This notebook contains instructions on additional files you will need.
